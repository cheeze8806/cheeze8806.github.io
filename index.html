	<p>The <a href="https://www.victoriagolf.com/">Victoria Golf Club</a>, founded in 1893, is the oldest 18-hole golf course in Canada in its original location, and second oldest in North America. The course began as 14 holes but quickly expanded to 18 in 1895. There have been at least three different layouts - the one played today was finalized in the mid-1920's (after a decision in 1923 to end the practice of hitting tee shots on two holes across the ever-busier Beach Drive).</p>
	<p>Our stately Clubhouse, completed in 1928 and is a registered Canadian Historic Place, has undergone a number of expansions and renovations (including the most recent in 1993) and provides a grand and comfortable venue to begin your own memories. When you walk through this storied building, you'll be reminded of a rich history of golf, companionship, and community that spans over generations. Perhaps one of the most obscure yet heartwarming examples is a series of photos of a foursome on the course, taken annually on the same date over five decades.</p>
